# Week 4 Assignments

## Linked Lists

-   [x] Reverse-linked-list [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list)
-   [x] odd-even-linked-list [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list)
-   [ ] reverse-nodes-in-k-group [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group)
