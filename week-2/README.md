Multisets

-   [] Find-all-anagrams-in-a-string Link[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/]
    -   Use a multiset for this one. You can also solve it without using one. How? Try to solve it both ways. How do the two solutions compare?

    -   This one has a few “clever” solutions but feel free to use a simple multiset solution.

-   [] Number-of-atoms Link[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms/]

    -   This one is more difficult than the average interview question but it is good exercise! You will need to build a simple parser in addition to using a multiset.
